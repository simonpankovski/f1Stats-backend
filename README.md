# F1 Stats - Backend

Backend Code for the F1 statistics web application. Made with Spring Boot and PosgreSQL, following the RESTful API architectural principles. The frontend consist of a UI implemented in React, Redux and Bootstrap. Additionally I added D3.js as a means to render charts and graphs using the data from the database.
